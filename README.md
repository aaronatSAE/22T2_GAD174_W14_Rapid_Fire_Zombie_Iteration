## Task
You have been hired as a contractor for 1 day to finish a set of assets inherited from an employee that is about to go on extended leave.

### Step 1: Planning (10 minutes)
Plan and document an interesting, moderately complex 3D model/prop that could be held in one or two hands in a magic/high fantasy game (think LOTR, WoW...).
Sort out inspiration images, make a mood board, describe the asset in documentation…

### Step 2: Placeholder (15 minutes)
Develop a placeholder asset for the prop.

### Step 3: Shippable (25 minutes)
Get the asset to a shippable standard.

### Step 4: Staging (35 minutes)
Implement the asset into the provided Unity project.

# End Goal
Staged asset implemented in Unity, functioning and looking like the originally-planned asset!

# Notes
* Stick to the documentation/plans!
* You should improve the prop, not change it entirely.
* The project you start with will not be the project you end with.

# Outcomes
* You need to be flexible
* You need to work on the fly
* You need to find a quick way to improve the assets handed to you

# Reflection
* What went well?
* What didn't go well?
* What did you learn?
* What could be done better next time?
* …

# Success Criteria
* I can clearly and concisely document my plans for a 3D prop.
* I can interpret documentation/plans to successfully create a 3D model based on the intent of the original designer.
* I can develop an appropriately-complex and workable 3D prop into a game development pipeline spanning multiple developers.
* I can implement an existing 3D model into a game engine and set it up based on the original designs.
